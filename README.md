# Search-Engine-Interface-for-Wikipedia
Wikipedia has so many articles covering various subjects, it would make a great search engine for learning many things, therefore it inspired me to create a search engine application with the aim of making the interface simple and accessible that can generate results, links and images from Wikipedia, inspired by Googleâ€™s UI design. Built through HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Wikipedia API. Created to support screen readers and small displays as well.
